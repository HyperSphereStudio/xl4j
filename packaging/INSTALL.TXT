To install this add-in, you can either run the add-in one-off, in which case
it won't open each time you run Excel, or by using the Excel add-in manager to 
install the add-in so it runs each time you run Excel.

Firstly you need to determine if you have 32-bit or 64-bit office installed.
If you don't know, you probably have the 32-bit version installed, but if you
want to check, you can find out by:

  1) Start Microsoft Excel
  2) Click the File tab in the ribbon
  3) Then click Account
  4) On the right, you should seee an About button
  5) Click on the About button and you should see either 32-bit or 64-bit
     on the right of the version number.

Installing a Java Runtime Environment
=====================================
You must have a (free) Java Runtime Environment installed.  This can be 
downloaded from: 

  https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp

It is important that you choose the correct version.  If you're using a 32-bit
version of office, install the 32-bit JRE (they're often not labelled as 32-bit
so just look for the downloads that are not labelled 64-bit).

Installing in Excel
===================
The XLL file can be found in:

  bin-x86\excel.xll       if you're using a 32-bit Excel
  bin-x64\excel.xll       if you're using a 64-bit Excel

Again, if you don't know if your version of Excel is 32-bit or 64-bit, it's 
probably 32-bit.

You can just double-click on these XLL files to run the add-in for just one
session, but usually you'd want to make it so that the add-in would be 
available every time you start Excel. To do that you need to open the Excel
add-in manager:

  1) Start Microsoft Excel
  2) Click the File tab in the ribbon
  3) Then click Options 
  4) On the right, towards the bottom, you

Install permanently
