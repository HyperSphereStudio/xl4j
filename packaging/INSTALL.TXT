To install this add-in, you can either run the add-in one-off, in which case
it won't open each time you run Excel, or by using the Excel add-in manager to 
install the add-in so it runs each time you run Excel.

Do you have 32-bit or 64-bit Excel?
===================================
Firstly you need to determine if you have 32-bit or 64-bit office installed.
If you don't know, you probably have the 32-bit version installed, but if you
want to check, you can find out by:

  1) Start Microsoft Excel
  2) Click the File tab in the ribbon
  3) Then click Account
  4) On the right, you should seee an About button
  5) Click on the About button and you should see either 32-bit or 64-bit
     on the right of the version number.

Installing a Java Runtime Environment
=====================================
You must have a (free) Java Runtime Environment installed.  This can be 
downloaded from: 

  https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp

It is important that you choose the correct version.  If you're using a 32-bit
version of office, install the 32-bit JRE (they're often not labelled as 32-bit
so just look for the downloads that are not labelled 64-bit).

Installing in Excel
===================
The XLL file can be found in:

  bin-x86\excel.xll       if you're using a 32-bit Excel
  bin-x64\excel.xll       if you're using a 64-bit Excel

Again, if you don't know if your version of Excel is 32-bit or 64-bit, it's 
probably 32-bit.

You can just double-click on these XLL files to run the add-in for just one
session, but usually you'd want to make it so that the add-in would be 
available every time you start Excel. To do that you need to open the Excel
add-in manager:

  1) Start Microsoft Excel
  2) Click the File tab in the ribbon
  3) Then click Options 
  4) Click Add-ins in the left panel
  5) At the bottom, you will see 'Manage: [Excel Add-ins] [Go...]', click Go
  6) The Add-ins available list will show currently installed Add-ins.  Add
     the appropriate XLL file by clicking Browse... and navigating to the 
     right excel.xll file (see above), and choose OK.
  7) You should get a pop-up box saying Thanks for installing XL4J and a new
     entry in the list labelled XL4J.  If you do not see that, or see 'excel'
     in the list, see the troubleshooting section.
  8) Click OK to close the Window.

You should now be able to use XL4J.  To check it's loaded try using one of
the example sheets or just test the 'MyAdd' function by putting:
  
  =MyAdd(1,2) 

in any cell.  If you see 3, the Add-in has loaded correctly.  If you see
#NAME, then see the troubleshooting section.

See the user guide for information about how to use the add-in.

Troubleshooting
===============
Things to check if you have problems installing:

  * Have you installed an add-in that corresponds to the version of Excel
    you haver?  32-bit excel should use the add-in in the bin-x86 directory.
  * Check the Java Runtime you have installed corresponds to the version
    of Excel/the add-in you have.  32-bit Excel requires a 32-bit JRE or
    JDK, 64-bit Excel requires a 64-bit JRE or JDK.  You cannot (currently)
    use a 64-bit JDK from a 32-bit Excel or vice-versa.
  * Check that you have not tried to install more than one add-in based on
    XL4J at the same time.  Currently you can't do this because of JVM 
    limitations (one JVM per process), although we intend to support it in
    future versions.  If you have, try uninstalling the other add-in.
    It's actually possible to merge the functionality of two add-ins by 
    add-in the lib directory of one to the other (assuming they're based
    on the same underlying version of XL4J).
  * Occasionally a bug in Excel can lead to it getting confused about old
    add-ins.  This step should only be done after consulting with your 
    local administrator.

    First, make sure you close down Excel completely.   Then you need to 
    open the registry editor (regedit.exe): search for it via the start
    menu if you're not familiar.  Once it's open, find the key (which look
    like folders) under:

      HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\<your version>\Excel

    where "your version" is:
      
      16.0 for Excel 2016
      15.0 for Excel 2013
      14.0 for Excel 2010

    then look under the 'Add-in Manager' key and you will see the 
    installed add-ins.  If any entries end with excel.xll (you might need 
    to make the 'Name' column wider to see the end), you should remove 
    them by right-clicking and choosing 'Delete'.

    Also check the 'Options' key and if there's a key called 'OPEN' whose
    value refers to excel.xll (again, you might need to make the Data 
    column wider to be able to see) you should delete it too, again by 
    right clicking and choosing 'Delete'. 

    You should then restart Excel and try the installation procedure 
    again.
