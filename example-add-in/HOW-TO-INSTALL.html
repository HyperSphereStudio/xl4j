    <h1>XL4J Example Add-in</h1>
    <p>Installation Instructions</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container-fluid">
	<p>To install this add-in, you can either run the add-in one-off, in which case
      it won't open each time you run Excel, or by using the Excel add-in manager to 
      install the add-in so it runs each time you run Excel.
    </p>
	<h2>Do you have 32-bit or 64-bit Excel?</h2>
    <p>Firstly you need to determine if you have 32-bit or 64-bit office installed.
	If you don't know, you probably have the 32-bit version installed, but if you
	want to check, you can find out by:
	<ol>
      <li>Start Microsoft Excel</li>
      <li>Click the File tab in the ribbon</li>
      <li>Then click Account</li>
      <li>On the right, you should seee an About button</li>
      <li>Click on the About button and you should see either 32-bit or 64-bit
          on the right of the version number.</li>
    </ol>
	</p>

    <h2>Installing a Java Runtime Environment</h2>
    <p>You must have a (free) Java Runtime Environment installed.  This can be 
      downloaded from:</p>
    <div class="well">
      <a href="https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp">https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp</a>
	</div>
    <p>It is important that you choose the correct version.  If you're using a 32-bit
      version of office, install the 32-bit JRE (they're often not labelled as 32-bit
      so just look for the downloads that are not labelled 64-bit).</p>

    <h2>Installing in Excel</h2>
    <p>The XLL file can be found in:<p>
    <div class="well">
	  <table>
	    <tr>
	      <td><code>bin-x86\excel.xll</code></td><td>if you're using a 32-bit Excel</td>
        </tr>
	    <tr>
          <td><code>bin-x64\excel.xll</code></td><td>if you're using a 64-bit Excel</td>
	    </tr>
	  </table>
	</div>
	<p>Again, if you don't know if your version of Excel is 32-bit or 64-bit, it's 
      probably 32-bit.</p>
    <p>You can just double-click on these XLL files to run the add-in for just one
      session, but usually you'd want to make it so that the add-in would be 
      available every time you start Excel. To do that you need to open the Excel
      add-in manager:</p>
    <ol>
	  <li>Start Microsoft Excel</li>
      <li>Click the File tab in the ribbon</li>
      <li>Then click Options</li>
      <li>Click Add-ins in the left panel</li>
      <li><p>At the bottom, you will see:</p>
	  <div class="well">
	  Manage: <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs">Excel Add-ins <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down"></span></button> <button class="btn-xs">Go...</button>
	  </div>
	   <p>Click the <button class="btn-xs">Go...</button> button</p></li>
      <li>The Add-ins available list will show currently installed Add-ins.  Add
        the appropriate XLL file by clicking <button class="btn-xs">Browse...</button> and 
		navigating to the right <code>excel.xll</code> file (see above), and choose 
		<button class="btn-xs">OK</button>.</li>
      <li>You should get a pop-up box saying Thanks for installing XL4J and a new
          entry in the list labelled XL4J.  If you do not see that, or see 'excel'
          in the list, see the troubleshooting section.</li>
      <li>Click <button class="btn-xs">OK</button> to close the Window.
	</ol>
    <p>You should now be able to use XL4J.  To check it's loaded try using one of
	  the example sheets or just test the <code>MyAdd</code> function by putting:
    <div class="well">
    <code>=MyAdd(1,2)</code>
	</div>
    <p>in any cell.  If you see 3, the Add-in has loaded correctly.  If you see
      <code>#NAME</code>, then see the troubleshooting section.</p>
    <p>See the user guide for information about how to use the add-in.</p>

    <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
    <p>Things to check if you have problems installing:</p>
    <ul>
	  <li><p>If when you add the add-in, you get a pop-up dialog box that says:</p>
	  <div class="well">
      <cite>"The file format and extension of 'excel.xll' don't match.  The file
        could be corrupted or unsage.  Unless you trust its source, don't
        open it.  Do you want to open it anyway".</cite>
	  </div>
      <p>you are probably trying to load/run the add-in from within a zip
        archive.  Make sure you unzip the download by right-clicking and
        choosing "Extract All..." in Windows File Explorer.</p>
      <li>Have you installed an add-in that corresponds to the version of Excel
        you haver?  32-bit excel should use the add-in in the bin-x86 directory.</p>
      <li>Check the Java Runtime you have installed corresponds to the version
        of Excel/the add-in you have.  32-bit Excel requires a 32-bit JRE or
        JDK, 64-bit Excel requires a 64-bit JRE or JDK.  You cannot (currently)
        use a 64-bit JDK from a 32-bit Excel or vice-versa.</p>
      <li>Check that you have not tried to install more than one add-in based on
        XL4J at the same time.  Currently you can't do this because of JVM 
        limitations (one JVM per process), although we intend to support it in
        future versions.  If you have, try uninstalling the other add-in.
        It's actually possible to merge the functionality of two add-ins by 
        add-in the lib directory of one to the other (assuming they're based
        on the same underlying version of XL4J).</li>
      <li><p>Occasionally a bug in Excel can lead to it getting confused about old
        add-ins.  This step should only be done after consulting with your 
        local administrator.</p>
        <p>First, make sure you close down Excel completely.   Then you need to 
        open the registry editor (regedit.exe): search for it via the start
        menu if you're not familiar.  Once it's open, find the key (which look
        like folders) under:</p>
        <div class="well">
        <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\&lt;<i>internal version number</i>&gt;\Excel</code>
		</div>
        <p>where &lt;<i>internal version number</i>&gt; is:</p>
		<div class="well">
		<table>
		  <tr>
		    <th>&lt;<i>internal version number</i>&gt;</th>
			<th>Public version</th>
	      </tr>
		  <tr>
            <td>16.0</td><td>Excel 2016</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
            <td>15.0</td><td>Excel 2013</td>
	      </tr>
		  <tr>
            <td>14.0</td><td>Excel 2010</td>
          </tr>
		</table>  
		</div>
		<p>then look under the 'Add-in Manager' key and you will see the 
          installed add-ins.  If any entries end with excel.xll (you might need 
          to make the 'Name' column wider to see the end), you should remove 
          them by right-clicking and choosing 'Delete'.</p>
        <p>Also check the 'Options' key and if there's a key called 'OPEN' whose
          value refers to excel.xll (again, you might need to make the Data 
          column wider to be able to see) you should delete it too, again by 
          right clicking and choosing 'Delete'.</p>
        <p>You should then restart Excel and try the installation procedure 
          again.</p>
      </li>
