By default, when you launch XL4J, once a day it will check for availability of 
updates by checking for the existence of a web page on the McLeod Moores website.  
No user-identifying information is sent with this check, but your IP address will
be logged by the web server in the same way as if you visited our website with a 
browser.  You can turn off this behavior by unchecking the check for updates 
setting on the settings dialog.  If you don't want it to do even an initial 
check, you can change create a file called 'deafult.ini' in the install directory
with the following contents:

[Add-in]
CheckForUpgrades=No
