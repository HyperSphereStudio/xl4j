	<p>For information on installing this add-in, see the <a href="HOW-TO-INSTALL.html">Installation Guide</a></p>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>This add-in is intended to demonstrate the type of add-in you can build using XL4J.  It demonstates a
	  broad range of functionality split broadly into purely financial and general purpose.</p>
	<h3>Financial Features</h3>
	<p>These features are used to demonstrate how specific financial applications can be built.  It is not intended to
	    be exhaustive, but simply to support the demonstration sheets we have created.
	  <ul>
	    <li>Pulling data from the Quandl data service</li>
		<li>Processing Quandl data into Time Series objects</li>
		<li>Schedule generation for time series sampling</li>
		<li>Time series manipulation
		  <ul>
		    <li>arithmetic operations</li>
		    <li>padding</li>
			<li>statistics (variance, covariance, correlation, correlation matrices)</li>
			<li>sampling using generated schedules</li>
			<li>a variety of returns calculators</li>
		  </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Credit Default Swaps
		  <ul>
		    <li>CDS Trade object creation</li>
			<li>Compute Accrual start and end dates/times; Annuity payments, Payment dates/times</li>
			<li>ISDA standard credit and yield curve creation</li>
			<li>ISDA standard analytics, pricing per leg, hazard rates,
    			survival probabilities, interpolation on curves, etc.</li>
			<li>More flexible than the ISDA CDS Excel add-in</li>
		  </ul>
		</li>
		<li>Supporting functions
		  <ul>
		    <li>Matrix expansion</li>
			<li>Schedule expansion</li>
		  </ul>
		</li>
	  </ul>
	</p>
	<h3>General purpose features</h3>
	<p>Thes features are applicable those both inside and outside the financial services sector.
	  <ul>
	    <li>Asynchronous REST queries</li>
		<li>JSON Decoding and object drilldown, query and expansion</li>
		<li>Dynamic Java invocation
		  <ul>
		    <li>Create objects by calling constructors</li>
			<li>Call static and dynamic methods</li>
			<li>Create enum instances</li>
			<li>Extract static and dynamic field values</li>
			<li>Chain method calls</li>
			<li>Create arrays (primitive and not) and containers</li>
			<li>Choose simplest or object reference return types (the X variant of functions always return object references)</li>
			<li>Automatic type marshalling</li>
			<li>Use can be mixed with custom functions</li>
		  </ul>
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	</p>

			<th>Description</th>
	      </tr>
		  <tr>
            <td><a href="examples/rest-countries.xlsx">rest-countries.xlsx</a></td>
			<td>Calls out to a REST service provided by groupkt.com that returns country code information via JSON.  It demonstrates constructing a request, executing it, and drilling down into the JSON response to extract the useful data.</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
            <td><a href="examples/swing-image.xlsx">swing-image.xlsx</a></td><td>This is a slightly silly demonstration that writes the pattern set into a grid of 
			Excel cells and creates a Swing toolkit window reflecting the pattern.  It is just meant to show the use of the Java primitives and does not deal with issues like multi-threading access to Swing components in a serious way.</td>
	      </tr>
		  <tr>
            <td><a href="examples/sovereign-cds-pricing-and-risk.xlsx">sovereign-cds-pricing-and-risk.xlsx</a></td>
			<td>A more serious example showing a portfolio of Soverign (although it could be readily adapter to non-soverign CDS with the appropriate data) CDS
			pricing and risk.  Both yield and credit curves are created from real (historical, hardcoded) market data, CDS are priced and have both credit and
			interest rate risk calculated in bucketed form and displayed both per-trade and per-currency.  Various other analytics are also displayed.</td>
          </tr>
		  <tr>
		    <td><a href="time-series-and-efficient-frontier.xlsm">time-series-and-efficient-frontier.xlsm</a></td>
			<td>A long-only equity portfolio analysis using real data pulled from the Quandl data service (refresh requires a free sign-up and API key, instructions
			on first sheet of workbook).  Pulls historical data for a sample portfolio, computes mean return, variance, standard deviation and then calculates 
			covariance, correlation and CAPM Beta against the index.  We then use VBA to drive the standard Excel Solver add-in (which will need to be enabled
			if you want to recalculate) to optimise a selection of portfolios for minimum risk, given a set target return for each one.  Using this, we create an 
			'efficient frontier' graph showing the risk/return trade-off.  There's also a test portfolio allowing you to show a specific portfolio within this.  Lastly
			as a sanity check, we optimize a portfolio to maximise it's Sharpe ratio.  Drawing a line through this point and the origin should be at a tangent to the edge of the frontier.  To run the solver, you need to enable macros so the sheet can configure the solver automatically when you click the buttons.</td>
